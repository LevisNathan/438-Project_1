My theme is Tech. i am getting images based on Circuit boards, which are a very techy thing. for the tweets i am searching tech in general.
one error i would say with my code is that i was unable to reupload my html file which is why the tweet is not in the center.
another issue is that my project does not use the variables and so my api keys are on github.
if i where to improve this project i would find a way to increase the res on the images. i would also like to find a better way to use css files.
